# Updater-channel publish hook for the ForkHub Natively channel.
# Runs in the shared workflow's publish phase with GH_TOKEN, TARGET, DIST,
# UPSTREAM_TAG and GITHUB_REPOSITORY set. Publishes dist artifacts carrying
# electron-updater manifests to the `v<version>` release in this catalog
# repo — that release is the feed the patched app polls (see
# electron/update/updateFeed.ts). The fork version `-fh.<owner>.<n>` is a
# semver prerelease whose channel (`fh`) is what the updater matches on the
# shared catalog atom feed, skipping every other target's releases.
# The shared step separately publishes the namespaced *-fhN bundle (which
# also carries the .deb).
